# MOD-Forensic-Scenes
Beyond First Glance (BFG) is a forensics-focused 3D benchmark comparing metrically scaled LiDAR and 3D Gaussian Splatting across five simulated manner-of-death scenes. Includes point clouds/meshes, pretrained 3DGS, photos/videos, ROI annotations, and a reproducible suite for geometry, coverage, efficiency, and robustness. With baselines and metrics.

# How to use
The dataset is provided in compressed ZIP files. Please extract the files and update the directory paths in your code to reflect where you are storing the dataset on your device.

# To Know
This work is currently under consideration for publication under the title "Beyond First Glance: A Quantitative Benchmark of 3D LiDAR Scanning vs. Gaussian Splatting for Forensic Analysis of Manner of Death."
