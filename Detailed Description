Title
Beyond First Glance (BFG): A Manner‑of‑Death Forensic 3D Benchmark Dataset

Summary
Beyond First Glance provides a metrically scaled, forensics‑focused 3D benchmark comparing terrestrial LiDAR scanning and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) across five simulated scenes aligned with medicolegal manner‑of‑death (MOD) categories: Natural, Accident, Suicide, Homicide, and Undetermined. The repository packages paired LiDAR point clouds/meshes and pretrained 3DGS models with synchronized 2D photographs and short videos, evidence markers, region‑of‑interest (ROI) annotations, and a reproducible evaluation suite covering geometry, coverage, efficiency, and robustness. It enables quantitative, apples‑to‑apples comparisons and supports best‑practice workflows for documentation, measurement, and visualization in forensic investigations.

What’s included

Five MOD scenes: Natural, Accident, Suicide, Homicide, Undetermined.
Modalities and assets:
LiDAR: metrically scaled point clouds and meshes suitable for measurement.
3DGS: pretrained Gaussian splat models for photorealistic, real‑time viewing.
2D media: synchronized photographs and short videos used for 3DGS training/validation.
Annotations: evidence markers and ROI labels aligned across modalities.
Metadata: capture notes, scale factors, coordinate frames, and camera intrinsics/extrinsics (where applicable).
Evaluation suite (notebooks; A.* = geometry/accuracy, B.* = density/coverage/efficiency/robustness):

Benchmark protocol and metrics

Geometry fidelity: distance‑to‑reference, symmetric Chamfer distance (A.1), point‑to‑plane RMSE with residuals (A.3), edge/curvature preservation (A.4).
Cross‑modal match accuracy: thresholded F‑scores at 1/2/5 cm (A.2).
Sampling and coverage: point density, nearest‑neighbor spacing, scene coverage (B.1, B.3).
Efficiency: processing time and peak memory (B.2).
Robustness: sensitivity to controlled perturbations and environmental challenges (B.4).
Key findings (from the included study)

LiDAR achieves lower mean/median distance‑to‑reference errors across all scenes; inter‑modality symmetric Chamfer distances show significant gaps (mean ≈ 5.74).
Cross‑modal F‑scores increase monotonically with tolerance (macro‑F1 ≈ 0.012 @ 1 cm, 0.039 @ 2 cm, 0.134 @ 5 cm), with the Homicide scene highest at F1 ≈ 0.267 @ 5 cm.
3DGS offers operational advantages: ≈ 383× faster average model loading and ≈ 10× lower peak memory than LiDAR meshes/point clouds at test scales.
Both modalities exhibit similar sensitivity to minor synthetic vertex noise at the tested levels.
Recommended workflow: use LiDAR (or LiDAR‑regularized radiance fields) for geometry‑critical measurements and 3DGS for rapid, photorealistic visualization; report results with standardized metrics to enable reproducible MOD benchmarking.
Intended use

Forensic science R&D, training, and quantitative benchmarking.
Method development for scene reconstruction, registration, and measurement under MOD‑relevant constraints.
Cross‑modal evaluation of geometry fidelity vs. operational efficiency.

Getting started

Ensure consistent metric scale across modalities; use provided transforms/units.
Optional viewers: any LiDAR/mesh tool supporting PLY/OBJ/GLB and a 3DGS viewer/renderer.
Reproduce baseline metrics by running the notebooks in the A.* then B.* order; export per‑scene and macro summaries.
Baseline reporting

Provide per‑scene and macro results for A.1–A.4, B.1–B.4.
Recommended F‑score thresholds: 1 cm, 2 cm, 5 cm for cross‑modal overlap.
Include timing and peak memory for load, render, and metric computation steps.
Ethics and safety

Scenes are simulated; no real victims or personally identifiable information.
